2. Average accuracy from 10-folds cross validation is as follow.
	KNN: 0.697197 with SD = 0.049779
	CART: 0.620518 with SD = 0.048222

5. Analyze process and results
	i) 	Data of most features are skewed to the right ('age', 'diabetes-pedigree-function', 'pregnant-time', 'serum-insulin', 'skin-fold-thickness')
		Data of some feature are like normal distribution ('blood-pressure', 'body-mass-index', 'glucose-concentration')
	ii)	KNN performs a little bit better than Decision Tree regarding accuracy, precision, recall and also F1 score.
		
		### KNN results on test data
		Accuracy: 0.681818181818
		Precision: 0.67
		Recall: 0.68
		F1: 0.66

		### CART results on test data
		Accuracy: 0.642857142857
		Precision: 0.65
		Recall: 0.64
		F1: 0.64

		# Note that the results can be different every time we run the code
